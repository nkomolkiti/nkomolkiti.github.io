					<h4>Danger from Lead</h4>
					<p>Elevated level of Lead can be very dangerous for <font class="redText">pregnant women and young children.</font> Young children, infants, and fetuses are particularly vulnerable to lead because the effects of lead occur at lower exposure levels in children than in adults. <font class="redText">A dose of lead that would have little effect on an adult can have a significant effect on a child.</font> It can lead to damage in the central and peripheral nervous system, learning disabilities, shorter stature, impaired hearing, and impaired formation and function of blood cells.</p>
					<p>For pregnant women, lead can be stored along with calcium and is released as maternal calcium to help form the bones of the fetus. This is especially true for a woman who does not have enough dietary calcium. </p>

				<h2>DESIGN METHODOLOGY</h2>
				<h4>Why this?</h4>
				<p>	Drinking from tap water is a common habit in Baltimore, but is there any guarantee that the water we drink is safe? Sometimes we could smell Chlorine, and sometimes metallic tastes.
				[ Lead in Our Drinking Water? ] offers insights to the problem, how to prevent Lead in our drinking water, and shows graphic information of the whereabouts of the contaminated water sources. 
				Lead is one of the contaminants that is highly toxic to human body. Especially for children, as it takes less exposure to take effect, including disrupting brain development and, in case of pregnant women, the forming of fetus. 
				If looked back at Baltimore’s records of tested water, in 2007, average Lead level is higher than the acceptable rate of 15ppb. (parts per billion: one drop in 10,000 gallon of water) The earliest record of 2015 shows the improvement, but there are still at least seven locations where water is considered harmful. Some of these have the Lead level as high as 339ppb.</p>

				<h4>Why the map?</h4>
			<p>	The information was manually sourced from variety of credible government’s resources (included in Reference section). People are interested in not just how high the Lead level is, but also in knowing where those places are located. Map becomes the best function to show the overall locations across Baltimore and its county, and the level of contamination.</p>

			 <h4>Related news</h4>
				<p>There were instances in the past such as the Flint Water crisis (Michigan) where over 100,000 people were exposed to high levels of lead in the drinking water. Lead also links to the outbreak of other water-related diseases such as Legionnaires' disease, which happened soon after the Flint River, contaminated by Lead, was used as the main source of drinking water.
